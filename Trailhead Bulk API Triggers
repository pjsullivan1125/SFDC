//The Purpose of this was to write a trigger where I create a task when an opportunity is listed as closed won. 
//Originally I thought that we'd make an opportunity list here but in retrospect, we'd make a task list here. 
//So really, we create the task list first â†’ then we do a SOQL for an opportunity to determine that this is related to the new trigger
//and then its also closed won. 
//tasklist.add creates the task with the following fields
//If the tasklist's side is greater than 0, then insert the tasklist 

trigger ClosedOpportunityTrigger on Opportunity (after insert, after update) {
    List<Task> taskList = new List<Task>();
    //List<Opportunity> oppListTrail = new List <Opportunity>();
    For (Opportunity o: [SELECT Id, Name, StageName FROM Opportunity
                        WHERE Id IN :Trigger.new AND
                         (StageName  = 'Closed Won')]) {
                        
                             
                         taskList.add(new Task(Subject.    ='Follow Up Test Task',
                                                  Status   = 'Not Started',
                                                  Priority = 'Normal',
                                                  WhatId   = o.Id));
                         }
    If (taskList.size() > 0) {
        Insert taskList;
    }
}





//The Apex trigger must be called 'ClosedOpportunityTrigger'
//With 'ClosedOpportunityTrigger' active, if an opportunity is inserted or updated with a stage of 'Closed Won', it will have a task created with the subject 'Follow Up Test Task'.
//To associate the task with the opportunity, fill the 'WhatId' field with the opportunity ID.
//This challenge specifically tests 200 records in one operation.
